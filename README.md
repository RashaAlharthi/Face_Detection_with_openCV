# Face_Detection_with_openCV
This repo is for Smart-Methods AI Task3
In this task i use openCV with Haar Classifier so, the program will detect any face by using this classifier.
the (haarcascade_frontalface_default.xml) file is a trained haar classifier from the internet .. I try it and it's worked :)
