# Face_Detection_with_openCV
This repo is for Smart-Methods AI Task3
In this task i use openCV with Haar Classifier so, the program will detect any face by using this classifier.
The (haarcascade_frontalface_default.xml) file is a trained haar classifier from the internet .. I try it and it's worked :)
In the (realTimeFaceDetection.py) file I wrote the code with comment to explain every part of it, first import openCV lib then, load the cascade then, read the input and detect the faces then, draw rectangle around the faces then, display the output then stop the run because the loop will keep running the drawing instuction and finally, destroy all windows.
